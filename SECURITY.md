# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates only for the main development branch.  
Older releases may or may not receive patches.

| < 1.0   | ❌                 |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, report it privately via GitHub direct message.


We will confirm receipt, and aim to provide a fix within a reasonable timeframe.  
Once fixed, we will credit you (if desired) in the release notes.

## Disclosure Policy

- You report the vulnerability to us privately.
- We triage and validate the issue.
- We prepare a patch and release.
- We coordinate a public disclosure with you, if applicable.
